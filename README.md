## Interview Responses

### Q1 – Tell me about yourself
**Answer**: “I’m Gower Campbell, transitioning from filmmaking—where I crafted projects like my interactive MA film ‘Veiled Descent’—to a tech career as a DevOps Engineer. Filmmaking sharpened my creativity, attention to detail, and teamwork, skills I now apply to tech. Through HyperionDev’s Bootcamp, I achieved a 100% success rate, mastering Python, Django, and SQL, and building automated workflows with Git—foundational for DevOps. As a Teaching Assistant, I foster inclusivity, aligning with Sparta Global’s values. I’m drawn to your mission of empowering diverse talent and your hire-train-deploy model, eager to bridge development and operations as a Spartan.”

---

### Q2 – Why this role?
**Answer**: “I’m thrilled about the DevOps Engineer role because Sparta Global’s focus on uniting development and operations resonates with my journey from filmmaking—like my BA documentary ‘From the Roots of Aray’—to tech. Your hire-train-deploy model excites me—I bring Python and automation skills from HyperionDev and a problem-solving mindset from film, perfect for deploying stable platforms. I admire how you empower non-traditional talent and drive impactful systems, and my inclusivity work as a Teaching Assistant aligns with that. I’m eager to automate, monitor, and innovate as a Spartan.”

---

### Q3 – Strengths & Weakness
**Answer**: “My strengths are Python coding and automation—proven by my Bootcamp and GitHub ‘Workplace Repository’—plus creative problem-solving from filmmaking, like ‘Veiled Descent,’ and collaboration across teams. As a Teaching Assistant, I’ve honed adaptability, crucial for DevOps’ dynamic environments. My weakness? I’m refining my debugging speed—sometimes I dig deep into system errors, like optimizing SQL—but I’m proactive, practicing with tools like Visual Studio Code, cutting my troubleshoot time significantly.”

---

### Q4 – Technical Project
**Answer**: “In my HyperionDev Bootcamp, I built a Django web app with SQLite—now in my ‘Workplace Repository’ on GitHub. I hit slow query performance, so I automated SQL join optimization and tested with dummy data, improving load times by 30%. It was like editing a film—iterating for efficiency. This knack for streamlining processes and resilience is what I’d bring to Sparta Global’s DevOps projects, automating deployments and boosting system health.”

---

### Q5 – Explain a Concept
**Answer**: “Let’s take infrastructure as code, a DevOps cornerstone I’ve explored with Python. Imagine a film set—like ‘Veiled Descent’—where every prop is scripted and reusable. Infrastructure as code lets you define systems programmatically, deploy consistently, and tweak fast. I’ve used Git in my Bootcamp to manage workflows, a taste of this mindset. I’m excited to apply it at Sparta Global to provision resources and ensure repeatability.”

### Additional Questions

#### Q6 – Why join a hire-train-deploy company like Sparta Global?
**Answer**: “Sparta’s hire-train-deploy model is perfect for me—a proactive learner transitioning from filmmaking to DevOps with a 100% Bootcamp success rate. I loved automating Python workflows, and your 8-10 weeks of training would elevate my skills in tools like infrastructure as code. Deploying to clients—especially in media, where my film experience adds value—lets me impact systems while growing. Your inclusivity, like my TA work with special needs students, and focus on stable platforms draw me in.”

---

#### Q7 – How do you handle working in a team?
**Answer**: “Teamwork’s my forte, built in filmmaking—like syncing ‘From the Roots of Aray’ with communities—and Bootcamp projects using Git. In DevOps, I’d bridge dev and ops, just as I adapted materials as a Teaching Assistant for accessibility. I’m proactive—helping a teammate debug a script taught me to align efforts. I’d bring that to Sparta, collaborating to automate and monitor systems seamlessly.”

---

#### Q8 – What interests you about working with Sparta Global’s clients?
**Answer**: “Your clients in media and public sector spark my interest—my ‘Veiled Descent’ film fused tech and storytelling, so I’d love automating platforms for those fields. My Python and SQL skills from HyperionDev, plus a creative eye from film, equip me to monitor and optimize systems. It’s a chance to deliver fast, high-quality deployments and grow through real-world impact.”

---

#### Q9 – How do you approach learning new technologies?
**Answer**: “I dive in—my Bootcamp took me from zero to Python automation in months, building apps and workflows. I use docs, practice—like my GitHub projects—and tools like Visual Studio Code, mirroring how I mastered Adobe for film. At Sparta, I’d tackle DevOps tools like monitoring systems or CI/CD pipelines with the same drive, leveraging your training and Udemy access to contribute fast.”

---

#### Q10 – Tell us about a time you overcame a challenge.
**Answer**: “For ‘Veiled Descent,’ my MA film, interactive code failed pre-deadline. I researched, rebuilt it, and delivered on time. In tech, my Bootcamp app’s SQL queries lagged—I automated join optimization, tested dummy data, and cut load times by 30%. Both taught me to troubleshoot under pressure—skills I’d use to keep Sparta’s systems humming.”
